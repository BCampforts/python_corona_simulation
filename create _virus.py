vir3 = Virus(recovery_duration=(100,200))


# Instance from lethal corona virus
SARS_COV2 = Virus_Lethal(mortality_chance=0.02)

# Now, let quickly look into property validation, that is to validate 
# attributes of an instance of class
# e.g. mortality_chance must be greater than zero

# To do this we will use decorators 

# Okey, now, can you create a property validation method for the recovery_duration?
